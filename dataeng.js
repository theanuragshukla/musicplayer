All I do is drop F-bombs, feel my wrath of attack\r\nRappers are having a rough time period, here's a Maxipad\r\nIt's actually disastrously bad\r\nFor the wack while I'm masterfully constructing this masterpiece as\r\n\r\nI'm beginning to feel like a Rap God, Rap God\r\nAll my people from the front to the back nod, back nod\r\nNow who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box, slap box?\r\nLet me show you maintaining this shit ain't that hard, that hard\r\n\r\nEverybody want the key and the secret to rap immortality like I have got\r\nWell, to be truthful the blueprint's simply rage and youthful exuberance\r\nEverybody loves to root for a nuisance\r\nHit the earth like an asteroid, did nothing but shoot for the moon since\r\nMC's get taken to school with this music\r\n'Cause I use it as a vehicle to bus the rhyme\r\nNow I lead a new school full of students\r\nMe? I'm a product of Rakim, Lakim Shabazz, 2Pac N-\r\n-W.A, Cube, hey, Doc, Ren, Yella, Eazy, thank you, they got Slim\r\nInspired enough to one day grow up, blow up and be in a position\r\nTo meet Run DMC and induct them into the motherfuckin' Rock n'\r\nRoll Hall of Fame\r\nEven though I walk in the church and burst in a ball of flames\r\nOnly Hall of Fame I be inducted in is the alcohol of fame\r\nOn the wall of shame\r\nYou fags think it's all a game 'til I walk a flock of flames\r\nOff of planking, tell me what in the fuck are you thinking?\r\nLittle gay looking boy\r\nSo gay I can barely say it with a straight face looking boy\r\nYou witnessing a mass occur\r\nLike you watching a church gathering take place looking boy\r\nOy vey, that boy's gay, that's all they say looking boy\r\nYou get a thumbs up, pat on the back\r\nAnd a \"way to go\" from your label everyday looking boy\r\nHey, looking boy, what you say looking boy?\r\nI got a \"hell yeah\" from Dre looking boy\r\nI'mma work for everything I have\r\nNever ask nobody for shit, get outta my face looking boy\r\nBasically boy you're never gonna be capable\r\nTo keep up with the same pace looking boy\r\n\r\n'Cause I'm beginning to feel like a Rap God, Rap God\r\nAll my people from the front to the back nod, back nod\r\nThe way I'm racing around the track, call me Nascar, Nascar\r\nDale Earnhardt of the trailer park, the White Trash God\r\nKneel before General Zod this planet's Krypton, no Asgard, Asgard\r\n\r\nSo you be Thor and I'll be Odin, you rodent, I'm omnipotent\r\nLet off then I'm reloading immediately with these bombs I'm totin'\r\nAnd I should not be woken\r\nI'm the walking dead, but I'm just a talking head, a zombie floating\r\nBut I got your mom deep throating\r\nI'm out my Ramen noodle, we have nothing in common, poodle\r\nI'm a doberman, pinch yourself in the arm and pay homage, pupil\r\nIt's me, my honesty's brutal\r\nBut it's honestly futile if I don't utilize what I do though\r\nFor good at least once in a while\r\nSo I wanna make sure somewhere in this chicken scratch I scribble and doodle\r\nEnough rhymes to maybe to try and help get some people through tough times\r\nBut I gotta keep a few punchlines just in case 'cause even you unsigned\r\nRappers are hungry looking at me like it's lunchtime\r\nI know there was a time where once I\r\nWas king of the underground, but I still rap like I'm on my Pharoahe Monch grind\r\nSo I crunch rhymes, but sometimes when you combine\r\nAppeal with the skin color of mine\r\nYou get too big and here they come trying to\r\nCensor you like that one line I said on \"I'm Back\" from the Mathers LP\r\nOne when I tried to say \"I'll take seven kids from Columbine\r\nPut 'em all in a line, add an AK-47, a revolver and a nine\"\r\nSee if I get away with it now that I ain't as big as I was, but I'm\r\nMorphin' into an immortal coming through the portal\r\nYou're stuck in a time warp from 2004 though\r\nAnd I don't know what the fuck that you rhyme for\r\nYou're pointless as Rapunzel with fucking cornrows\r\nYou write normal, fuck being normal\r\nAnd I just bought a new Raygun from the future\r\nJust to come and shoot ya like when Fabolous made Ray J mad\r\n'Cause Fab said he looked like a fag at Maywhether's pad\r\nSingin' to a man while they played piano\r\nMan, oh man, that was a 24/7 special on the cable channel\r\nSo Ray J went straight to the radio station the very next day\r\n\"Hey, Fab, I'mma kill you\"\r\nLyrics coming at you at supersonic speed, (JJ Fad)\r\nUh, sama lamaa duma lamaa you assuming I'm a human\r\nWhat I gotta do to get it through to you I'm superhuman\r\nInnovative and I'm made of rubber\r\nSo that anything you say is ricocheting off of me and it'll glue to you\r\nI'm devastating, more than ever demonstrating\r\nHow to give a motherfuckin' audience a feeling like it's levitating\r\nNever fading, and I know that the haters are forever waiting\r\nFor the day that they can say I fell off, they'd be celebrating\r\n'Cause I know the way to get 'em motivated\r\nI make elevating music, you make elevator music\r\nOh, he's too mainstream\r\nWell, that's what they do when they get jealous, they confuse it\r\nIt's not hip hop, it's pop, 'cause I found a hella way to fuse it\r\nWith rock, shock rap with Doc\r\nThrow on Lose Yourself and make 'em lose it\r\nI don't know how to make songs like that\r\nI don't know what words to use\r\nLet me know when it occurs to you\r\nWhile I'm ripping any one of these verses diverse as you\r\nIt's curtains, I'm inadvertently hurtin' you\r\nHow many verses I gotta murder to\r\nProve that if you were half as nice, your songs you can sacrifice virgins too uh!\r\nSchool flunkie, pill junky\r\nBut look at the accolades the skills brung me\r\nFull of myself, but still hungry\r\nI bully myself 'cause I make me do what I put my mind to\r\nAnd I'm a million leagues above you, ill when I speak in tongues\r\nBut it's still tongue in cheek, fuck you\r\nI'm drunk so Satan take the fucking wheel, I'm asleep in the front seat\r\nBumping Heavy D and the Boys, still chunky, but funky\r\nBut in my head there's something I can feel tugging and struggling\r\nAngels fight with devils and, here's what they want from me\r\nThey asking me to eliminate some of the women hate\r\nBut if you take into consideration the bitter hatred I have\r\nThen you may be a little patient and more sympathetic to the situation\r\nAnd understand the discrimination\r\nBut fuck it, life's handing you lemons, make lemonade then\r\nBut if I can't batter the women how the fuck am I supposed to bake them a cake then?\r\nDon't mistake it for Satan\r\nIt's a fatal mistake if you think I need to be overseas\r\nAnd take a vacation to trip a broad\r\nAnd make her fall on her face and don't be a retard\r\nBe a king? Think not, why be a king when you can be a God?"
